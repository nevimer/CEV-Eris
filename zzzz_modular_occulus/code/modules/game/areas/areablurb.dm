/************
OKAY SO HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS

We have an area. When someone enters the area, it checks if this person has the preference enabled and if they haven't been in that area before. If both are false, it throws up a description.
The var is 'narrate'.

/area/eris/security/range
	name = "\improper Security - Firing Range"
	narrate = "The smell of gunpowder hovers in the air. Miniscule dents and pockets on the walls tell the story of past marksmanship."

/area/turret_protected/ai_upload
	narrate = "Cameras swivel to follow every single visible movement. The most costly room on the ship by a factor of ten."

/area/eris/crew_quarters/toilet/medbay
	narrate = "Overpowering cleaning odour. The floors are slippery and sticky at the same time."

/area/eris/maintenance/oldbridge
	narrate = "What used to be the bridge of a proud ship; now, a casket from which one stares longingly at the stars."

/area/eris/engineering/post
	narrate = "Stale air. It hurts to breathe. Nobody has been in here in a long time. Why are you?"

/area/eris/command/bridge
	narrate = "The full expanse of space lies before you, spread across the windows. Even at full power, the scanners fail to map even half of the dots of light making up the cosmic fillament."

/area/eris/crew_quarters/hydroponics/garden
	narrate = "There are shoeprints in the vegetation from folk coming and going. They used to grow flowers in here, she says."

/area/eris/command/courtroom

/area/eris/quartermaster/hangarsupply
	narrate = "The floors in the hangar are scuffed from the passage of countless technicians, crates, and boxes."

/area/eris/maintenance/section4deck4central
	narrate = "The constant trudge of boots on bare decking. The echos of bullets and traps in the side passages. A bit of light, but for how long?"

/area/eris/maintenance/section3deck5starboard
	narrate = "The crunch and whir of machinery scream the room's purpose. This is where old things go to die, and new materials are born again."

/area/eris/crew_quarters/baroscar
	narrate = "A half-bar, half-diner that makes for a comfy spot. The Landlord says the poor girl that built this place got stabbed to death by her wife."

/area/eris/security/oscarnuke
	narrate = "It's you that I'd lie with, as the atom bomb locks in. You faintly taste metal."

/area/outpost/museum
	narrate = "It's awfully dusty in this most remote corner of the world. This isn't on any map of Port Nowhere- not even the Landlord knows about this place. Or maybe he just didn't tell anyone?"
