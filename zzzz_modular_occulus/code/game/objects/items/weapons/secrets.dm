	I trust you’ve had ample time to revieable to extract a significant amount of data from the sample, and much of it suggw and compile my earlier reports about the bio-mechanical threat known as the “Hivemind”. I’ve taken it upon myself to dedicate most of our rSTUDY OF of the HSTUDY OF STUed- None oever its origin, it is unique to the Northern Light, like so many of the anomalies we encounter here.
	<br>
	Despite the valiant efforts o been able to fully rid the ship of it. Though it can be fought back and seemingly temporarily destroyed, it has shown the capability to emerge after some time and begin it’s attempted conquest once again.
	<br>
	Through the noble sacrifice of one of our Junior Research Assistants, we have been able to contain a small amount of material sourced from the Hivemind. Captain Lovelace is preparing a brief obituary and letters to the assistant’s immediate family, which will be included with this report.
	<br>
	Our team has benue to work hard to unlock the secrets of this shipen estf our security contractors and intensive eradication efforts, we’ve as of yet nots that we will be able to extract exponentially more if we were to obtain a larger sample. The most curious aspect of what we have discovered is that much of the code that we have been able to decrypt points towards the Church of Mekhane.
	<br>
	While we do not know how the Church is involved or related to the Hivemind, Father FATHER \[b\]FdWAfforts, we’ve as of yet nots\\] has been more than helpful and cooperative, providing texts and samples of their own software for comparison. As far as our analysis can tell, while the code of the Hivemind refers to Mekhane, it is unlikely that the Church had a hand in its creation, given the limited scope of their equipment on the ship. I have asked EES to pay close attention and notify me of any anomalous power readings from the Church. Better safe than sorry.

	    Mister Cooper,
	<br>
	I have no idea what you're expecting out of our lads. You haven't paid us for our last go at a spraydown. I don't think the fumigation is even working; I think the damn critters are getting stronger from it. They're vicious, too, and our Service Tech swears they're getting bigger. Don't know if I believe her, but this is all to say that we aren't liking our prospects at clearing this out with the fare that we usually have. We can try using less dilute stuff, but I don't think that'll cut the hole you're looking for.
	<br>
	I'll tell you what; we have some old stuff that we bought before the Solarian Government passed a regulation bill a couple years back. We aren't allowed to buy any more, and we're supposed to get rid of all of it by the end of 2425. Just to warn you, it's strong stuff. It's a more dilute version of the crud that the OBR used on Tau Ceti. Do \[b\]not\[/b\] breathe it in.
